**Article submissions to *Structure and Sense* are currently invite only. We hope to open submissions when we are set up.**

# Submission Types

S&S focuses upon short articles though we are happy to publish extended pieces. There is no word limit for our publications but we do encourage to concisely present their argument or research findings. Good writing is always a plus.

- Articles that report original empirical research or conceptual analyses that advance thinking on the relationship between technology and human understanding.
- Commentaries that present fresh perspectives on major public issues involving technology, work, and organizations or that respond to articles published in the journal.
- Review Essays that synthesise, analyze and provide context for multiple new publications.

Submissions in plaintext and reproducible formats are highly encouraged, though initial submissions should be in PDF format.

# Submission Guidelines

Article submissions of any type should be compiled into a single PDF document including cover letter, title page with author affiliations, and an anonymized manuscript.
