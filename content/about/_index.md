*Structure & Sense: A Journal of Meaning, Organization, and Technology* is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal publishing social-scientific and humanistic research on how technological and organizational systems shape meaning, work, and life in modernity. The journal’s aim is to understand how large-scale processes—automation, bureaucratization, datafication, and the rationalization of institutions—reorient human experience and transform the conditions of understanding itself.

We welcome theoretical and empirical contributions from across the social sciences and humanities that engage the intersection of structure and sense: how social orders organize perception, action, and purpose. Topics of interest include the transformation of work and occupations, automation and artificial intelligence, the organization of expertise, the moral and emotional consequences of rationalized systems, and the changing foundations of human well-being in an increasingly technical world.

*Structure & Sense* encourages scholarship that is conceptually ambitious, methodologically transparent, and willing to cross disciplinary boundaries. Our goal is to provide a venue for work that addresses the existential and interpretive dimensions of modern life without abandoning empirical rigor or sociological depth.

# How things are, is not how they have to be

We are a small team of scholars working to establish a new venue for scholarship. Your support and patience is greatly appreciated.
