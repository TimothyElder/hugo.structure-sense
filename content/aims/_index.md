*Structure & Sense* publishes interdisciplinary research on the relationship between technological systems, organizational forms, and human meaning in modern societies. The journal provides a venue for work that examines how rationalization, automation, and the division of labor reshape social life, transform work, and alter the human understanding of purpose, agency, and value.

We welcome theoretical and empirical contributions from sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history, and related fields that explore the cultural, organizational, and existential consequences of technological and bureaucratic change. Topics include—but are not limited to—the transformation of work and occupations, artificial intelligence and automation, the social organization of expertise, the moral and emotional dimensions of rationalized systems, and the interpretive conditions of life in contemporary institutions.

The journal favors conceptually ambitious, methodologically transparent, and substantively grounded scholarship that bridges social science and the humanities to illuminate how structure and sense are made—and remade—in the modern world.
