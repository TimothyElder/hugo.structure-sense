<p>S&amp;S does not accept submissions that include human subjects research that involves the administration of novel drug or medical therapies.</p>

<h2 id="preprints-allowed-recommend-osfarxivssrn">Preprints allowed (recommend OSF/ArXiv/SSRN)</h2>
<p>S&amp;S accepts articles that have appeared as pre-prints under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The submitted draft has substantial revisions that make it distinct from the pre-print edition</li>
<li>The corresponding author provides an explanation of how the submitted version of the paper differs from the pre-print</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ai-use-disclosure-in-methods">AI-use disclosure in methods</h2>
<p>AI tools cannot meet the requirements for authorship as they cannot take responsibility for the submitted work. As non-legal entities, they cannot assert the presence or absence of conflicts of interest nor manage copyright and license agreements.</p>
<p>Authors who use AI tools in the writing of a manuscript, production of images or graphical elements of the paper, or in the collection and analysis of data, must be transparent in disclosing in the Materials and Methods (or similar section) of the paper how the AI tool was used and which tool was used. Authors are fully responsible for the content of their manuscript, even those parts produced by an AI tool, and are thus liable for any breach of publication ethics.</p>
